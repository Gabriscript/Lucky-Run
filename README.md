# 🍀 Lucky Run

**Lucky Run** is an infinite 3D mobile gambling runner made with **Unity**.
A leprechaun runs forward automatically and at each crossroad the player must choose a direction, risking everything on a 50/50 outcome.

Inspired by the idea of **Russian roulette**, every choice can either reward the player or lead to instant Game Over.
